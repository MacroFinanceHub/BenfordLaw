* the `Advanced Tests`: Third Digits Analysis, Second Order Analysis, Summation Analysis
* the `Associated Tests`: Last-Two Digits Analysis, Number Duplication Analysis, Distortion Factor Model
* the `Conformity Tests`: Mantissae Analysis, Zipf's Law Analysis

## Requirements

The minimum Matlab version required is `R2014a`. In addition, the `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox` must be installed in order to properly execute the script.
