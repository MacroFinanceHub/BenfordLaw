# Benford Law

This script represents a full-featured framework for Benford's Law conformity assessment. It can be used in order to perform a wide variety of tests (most of which have been proposed by Nigrini et al., 2012):
* the `Primary Tests` (
* `Distortion Factor Model`

* `Mantissae Arc Test`
* `Number Duplication Analysis`
* `Zipf's Law Analysis`

## Requirements

The minimum Matlab version required is `R2014a`. In addition, the `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox` must be installed in order to properly execute the script.
